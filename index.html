           <p> There are times when life can feel like you’re holding a rotten potato. It happens to the best of us. Sometimes through 
               choices of our own, other times through insensitive or sinful choices of others, we find ourselves in a valley where all we 
               hear are the echoes of “Why me?” and “What now?” In this valley, it is far too easy to drink from wells of self-pity and far 
               too hard to nourish ourselves with gratitude. Nothing drowns out thanksgiving’s chorus like a reprise of of all that seems 
               missing in life.</p>
            <p>I was thinking and praying for some of my friends this morning who feel like their lives are defined more by their losses {or 
                by what they never had} than by who God has been and is to them. I prayed that God would refresh their hearts with good gifts and 
                grateful smiles; that he would renew their hope in his love and goodness to them. It hit me, this is a good exercise for all of us. 
                We should all frequently recount the things we love to do and get caught up in the motion of enjoying those things as an act of worship; 
                to let thankful lives make harmony with joy.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="music">
            <header><h2>Music</h2></header>
           <p>Simply put, listening to music helps us feel good. If we are sad or depressed, we can turn on music and the release of dopamine in our brains 
               is going to make us feel better. Music, in effect, is a drug that provides us with feelings of joy and pleasure.</p>
              
            
            <p> “If you want to keep your brain engaged throughout the aging process, listening to or playing music is a great tool. It provides a total brain workout.” 
                Research has shown that listening to music can reduce anxiety, blood pressure, and pain as well as improve sleep quality, mood, mental alertness, and memory.</p>
            
            <p>Music is a language of emotion in that it can represent different feelings and barge into the soul with no boundaries or limitations. People are always challenged 
                by the fact that “no one understands them” or know how they “really feel”, so they turn to music. ... Music also has the capacity to imitate emotions.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="dance">
            <header><h2>Dance</h2></header>
               <p>I enjoy how varied dance can be and the freedom of expression it gives. I love ballet in particular because of its beauty and complexity. Dancing makes me feel calm after 
                   a busy day, as well as energised. ... Dancing in my free time helps me to feel good about myself and pushes me to keep progressing and improving.</p>

                <p>Dance is more than just a sport, it's a passion. Dance is something you work hard for, something you put all of your spare time and effort into. Dance is a sport that you never want 
                    to give up on. ... You need to dance until the very end, until you are the best dancer you can possibly be.</p>
                <p>When you dance your body releases endorphins. This is a chemical that trigger's positive energy and good vibes! It helps improve our emotional state and reduce our perception of pain. 
                    So basically, dancing is your cure for happiness!</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="read">
            <header><h2>Read</h2></header>
            <p> Because reading increases your vocabulary and your knowledge of how to correctly use new words, reading helps you clearly articulate what you want to say. The knowledge you gain from reading also
                 gives you lots to talk about with others. I love talking to people - especially little kids - who read a lot</p>
            
                <p> Reading develops our brains and gives us the ability to understand life in a much better fashion. When you read a lot, you learn new words all the time. ... Not sure how many readers will agree
                     but I firmly believe books can go more in-depth than a movie can.</p>
            <p>It's really funny to try to identify with the characters of the book and to imagine the environment. I think reading develops the brain and gives you the ability to understand other people. Besides, 
                you develop your language if you read a lot because you learn new words all the time.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="sports">
            <header><h2>Sports</h2></header>
            <p>I love sports for everything they have taught me about teamwork, leadership, community, hard work, the pursuit of excellence and achieving goals. ... I love to coach, teach and inspire student-athletes around the World. 
                Sports inspire all of us to do great things. All while cheering positively for our favorite teams.</p>
                <p>Participation in sports allows kids to make lasting friendships, develop communication skills, feel a sense of community and learn to respect their teammates and coaches. Even athletes in individual sports learn to work 
                    as a team with their coach and make lasting friendships with others in their sport.</p>

            <header><h2>Games</h2></header>
            <p>A big reason why we love video games so much, I feel, is because they are an escape from our sometimes boring and monotonous lives. ... Another reason I believe we love video games is because they give us a sense of accomplishment.
                 The feeling you get when you complete a good game is a feeling that's hard to compete with.</p>
